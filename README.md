These are small projects that I have completed as assignments for the "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" on Coursera (sorted in order of increasing difficulty)

All programs are run on Codeskulptor, an interactive, web-based Python programming environment that allows Python code to be run in a web browser. http://www.codeskulptor.org/
